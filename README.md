This code is a Discord bot written in Python. It imports the discord library and os library. The bot has an array of grade IDs that it checks for and a blacklist of users. The bot also has functions to load the blacklist from a text file, save the blacklist to a text file, check grades of users every day, and ban users who are on the blacklist when they join the server. Finally, it connects to the Discord server using a token.

Enjoy ðŸ˜€!
